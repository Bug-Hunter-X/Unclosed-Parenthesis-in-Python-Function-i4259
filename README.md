This repository contains a simple Python code example demonstrating a common, yet often overlooked error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition.  The `bug.py` file showcases the error, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected code. This error can be challenging to identify, especially in larger codebases, because Python's error message isn't always immediately helpful in pinpointing the exact location of the missing parenthesis.
